## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CompanyWise HR contact.pdf                 # Input PDF file with HR emails
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ email_sender.ipynb                         # Main Python script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                                  # Documentation (you are here)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

Install required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install PyPDF2
```

> This script uses the built-in `smtplib`, `os`, `re`, and `email` libraries, which require no additional installation.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Text Extraction:**  
   Reads and extracts raw text from the input PDF using `PyPDF2`.

2. **Email Detection & Context Mining:**  
   Uses regular expressions to identify email addresses and analyze nearby text for:
   - **Name**
   - **Job Title**
   - **Company**

3. **Fallback Table Mode:**  
   If structured HR data is found in tabular format, attempts to parse it.

4. **Data Cleaning:**  
   Sanitizes names and companies, filling in missing information with smart defaults derived from the email domain or structure.

5. **Email Sending:**  
   Authenticates using SMTP (Gmail) and sends personalized emails with a resume attachment.

[Detailed self-introduction and technical qualifications]

Best regards,

## üîê Setup & Configuration

Edit the following variables inside the `main()` function before running:

```python
